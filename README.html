<h1 id="the-one-code-data-framework">The One-Code Data Framework</h1>
<p>One-Code is a data representation framework with a growing collection of associated software, initially designed in the context of the <a href="http://vertebrategenomesproject.org">Vertebrate Genomes Project</a> (VGP) to operate on all the forms of data involved in a DNA sequencing and assembly project. Data is represented in a very simple ASCII file format that is easy for both humans and programs to read and interpret. Moreover, there is a corresponding compressed and indexed binary version for each ASCII file so that production tools built with the One-Code library are very efficient in time and the size of the data files they manipulate. All fields are strongly typed and a specific collection of data types constituting a <em>schema</em> is specified in a schema file, that is itself a One-Code data file. A generic converter allows one to move between the ASCII and binary representations of data, and another core tool is provided to validate files against a given schema.</p>
<p>There are currently two packages. <strong>Core</strong> contains the general One-Code command-line utilities alluded to above, and a C-library supporting the development of One-Code applications. <strong>VGP</strong> contains the VGP-formats schema designed specifically for DNA sequencing and assembly applications, and a growing number of VGP-tools for importing and operating on data in this schema.</p>
<p>To make all libraries and command line tools just type <code>make</code> in this top level directory. Both packages have no dependencies on other software.</p>
