.
. these are blank lines, which can also be used for arbitrary comments, anywhere in the file
.
. below P lines give primary file types, and define the objects in this file
. then S is for secondary file types
. and D and C define the legal record types, all taking a CHAR, then STRING_LIST
.     D for standard linetypes saved without field compression
.     C means a linetype with field compression
. note we can, and do, also add arbitrary comments/descriptions after the data on each line
.
